## Global Trends in Mental Health: A Clustering and PCA-Based Approach
This study explores the relationship between mental health issues and socio-economic factors across various countries in the world. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising mental health prevalence, GDP, and behavioral metrics from the World Data repository, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques were applied to uncover underlying patterns and relationships. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, capturing almost 90% of the variance. Subsequently, K-means clustering, optimized with the Elbow method achieved 45% accuracy, and hierarchical clustering were employed to identify distinct groups within the data. Hierarchical clustering achieved a higher clustering accuracy of 56% compared to k-means. The findings highlight significant associations between socio-economic indicators and mental health prevalence, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers focused on global mental health challenges.

## Predicting Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders Using Supervised Learning
This study explores the relationship between the common mental health disorders and socioeconomic factors using a dataset from the Worl Data repository. The predictor variables primarily focus on economic indicators, such as GDP per Capita and Unemployment Rate, and the percentage of behavioral responses to mental health challenges, including seeking professional psychological help, taking prescribed medications, and making lifestyle adjustments. The response variables are the prevalence rates of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and eating disorders. The study employs both regression and classification techniques to analyze the data, utilizing machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and logistic regression. Random Forest models initially explained 48% to 71% of the variance in mental health disorders, with improved R-squared values after hyperparameter tuning. Notably, the tuned models achieved an R-squared of 0.51 for anxiety disorders, 0.65 for depressive disorders, and 0.78 for eating disorders. SVM models demonstrate the highest accuracy for anxiety disorders with linear and polynomial kernels (67.74%), depressive disorders with a linear kernel (54.84%), and eating disorders with a polynomial kernel (90.32%). Logistic regression, after standardizing the data, shows improved prediction accuracy for anxiety (76.19%) and eating disorders (nearly 100%), but a decrease in accuracy for depressive disorders (47.62%). The findings highlight the strong relationship between GDP, unemployment rates, and prevalence of mental health disorders, providing valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers to develop targeted interventions and strategies for improving mental health outcomes globally.
